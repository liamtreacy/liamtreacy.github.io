<h1>Welcome to my site</h1>
<p>My name is Liam Treacy. I'm a husband, a father, and I currently make my living helping to craft software solutions.</p>

<p>I see this site as being mainly tech focused but we will see.</p>

<p>I've worked on both greenfield projects and large legacy codebases. I find legacy systems especially fascinating â€” they carry history, have a proven battle record in the real world, and often hold a few mysteries waiting to be solved.</p>

<p>I consider myself a polyglot developer, comfortable with learning new languages, tools and technologies as needed. My primary experience includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>C#</li>
  <li>C++</li>
</ul>
