The distance from <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/pw1ec8WkjmZgns266">Times Square, New York</a> to a nice spot on <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/VF7R6b8KjYZuXNN46">Miami Beach, Florida</a> (exactly 25°46'29.5"N 80°07'46.4"W) is 2227 kilometers.

I am going to (virtually) walk that distance. I want to see how long it will take me, what interesting things I can see and learn along the way.

I set off on my journey. It's a still day, not cold. I make my way in the direction of Lower Manhattan.

I am 13 days and 98km into my journey. The nearest town is [East Windsor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Windsor,_New_Jersey), New Jersey. It's a place with about 30k residents. I've crossed to a different state and left New York behind since my last entry! I think I'll ring in the New Year at City Streets Bar & Grill. It's located at a mini-mall. A band called Tanglewood are playing. I wonder how far into 2025 my journey will take.

I am 58 days on this journey. I have completed 418km. I am in Fredericktowne Village, a bit north west of Washington D.C. Considering the day I want to just have something away from real restaraunts so will go to a nearby McDonalds (McDonald's, 2411 Osprey Way S, Frederick, MD 21701, United States). Quarter pounder meal with some nuggets. It seems like a nice area.

I am 103 days in! I have walked 740km. I must be over a third of the way... maybe. I am in Pamplin, Virgina. 

> The population was 138 at the 2020 United States census.

Btw there's a town nearby called Farmville, lol. I am gonna have ice cream from "Mr Bubbles" at 239 Main St. It's a cloudy day but 17 degrees.
