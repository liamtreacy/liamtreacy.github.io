The distance from <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/pw1ec8WkjmZgns266">Times Square, New York</a> to a nice spot on <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/VF7R6b8KjYZuXNN46">Miami Beach, Florida</a> (exactly 25°46'29.5"N 80°07'46.4"W) is 2227 kilometers.

I am going to (virtually) walk that distance. I want to see how long it will take me, what interesting things I can see and learn along the way.
