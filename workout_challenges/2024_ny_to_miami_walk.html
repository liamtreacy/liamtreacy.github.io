The distance from <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/pw1ec8WkjmZgns266">Times Square, New York</a> to a nice spot on <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/VF7R6b8KjYZuXNN46">Miami Beach, Florida</a> (exactly 25°46'29.5"N 80°07'46.4"W) is 2227 kilometers.

I am going to (virtually) walk that distance. I want to see how long it will take me, what interesting things I can see and learn along the way.

I set off on my journey. It's a still day, not cold. I make my way in the direction of Lower Manhattan.

Tuesday, December 31st, 2024:

I am 13 days and 98km into my journey. The nearest town is [East Windsor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Windsor,_New_Jersey), New Jersey. It's a place with about 30k residents. I've crossed to a different state and left New York behind since my last entry! I think I'll ring in the New Year at City Streets Bar & Grill. It's located at a mini-mall. A band called Tanglewood are playing. I wonder how far into 2025 my journey will take.

I am 58 days on this journey. I have completed 418km. I am in Fredericktowne Village, a bit north west of Washington D.C. Considering the day I want to just have something away from real restaraunts so will go to a nearby McDonalds (McDonald's, 2411 Osprey Way S, Frederick, MD 21701, United States). Quarter pounder meal with some nuggets. It seems like a nice area.

Tuesday, 1st April, 2025:

I am 103 days in! I have walked 740km. I must be over a third of the way... maybe. I am in Pamplin, Virgina. 

> The population was 138 at the 2020 United States census.

Btw there's a town nearby called Farmville, lol. I am gonna have ice cream from "Mr Bubbles" at 239 Main St. It's a cloudy day but 17 degrees.

Saturday, 28th June, 2025:

I have put in a lot more distance since last check-in. I am 1340km into my trip. I am in Kline, South Carolina. It's gonna be slightly cloudy but still reach temp of 33 degrees today.

The Baptist church looks nice and has lovely green surroundings. There's a small Mexican shop which will have to do for lunch. I think it's a day to stay in the shade.

Friday, 1st August, 2025:

1541km. I am in Jesup, Georgia. The local newspaper is The Press Sentinel ( https://www.thepress-sentinel.com/ ). It'll reach 35 c today. I am gonna eat at Jones Kitchen.

Tuesday, 9th September, 2025:

1820km. Ormond Beach, Florida. I am in the state! The population here is about 40k and it looks lovely. I'm going to chill in the Bailey Riverbridge Gardens and have a walk across the Halifax River to grab a bite to eat at Stonewood Grill & Tavern.

Friday, 26th September, 2025:

1200 miles. I'm at Cocoa Village. Just sticking along the coast for my walk. Crydermans Barbecue looks great. The streets, architecture and everything looks fun around Oleander Pointe Condominium.

Thursday, 23rd October, 2025:

1316 miles. Northwood Village. Not long to go, just 77 miles.
